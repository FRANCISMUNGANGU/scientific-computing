My repository contains two folders, Python-basics and scientific computing. The scientific computing contains a file called start.py, which contains the first code on numpy. This file can be run by writing the command, python start.py. To ensure no errors, make sure you have numpy install in you computer or virtual environment. The code in start.py demonstrates how to create an array using numpy and how the look like matrices.

In the python-basics folder there are 3 files namely: datatypes.py, control_structures.py and modular_functions.py. Each file is run by writing python [filename.py] The datatypes.py has code on different data structures in python. The modular_function.py contains a function that finds the areas of various shapes. It help me learn how to avoid redundacy in code by using functions. Finally, the control_structures.py has a function that classifies a number as even and odd. Also, there are two loops, one for printing even numbers from 50 - 0 and the other to print numbers from 10 - 1
